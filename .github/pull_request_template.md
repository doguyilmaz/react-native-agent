# Merge Guidance

‚ùó Please use a **squash merge** unless there is an explicit reason you need to use a different merge strategy (e.g. you are bringing in changes from a previous release branch, or you have specific changes in your branch that you would like to retain). This keeps our commit history clean, makes changes more atomic, and makes it easier to revert changes.
